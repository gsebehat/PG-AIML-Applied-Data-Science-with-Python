Marketing Mix Analysis

This project focuses on exploring customer acquisition factors through the lens of the marketing mix's four Ps: Product, Place, Promotion, and People. 
Using a dataset containing demographic, spending, and campaign-related information, we conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and 
feature engineering. Key steps include handling missing values, outlier treatment, visualizing distributions, and analyzing correlations. 
Additionally, we test hypotheses related to shopping preferences, campaign performance, and sales trends. 
Insights derived from this analysis can help optimize marketing strategies.
